    	<p>With the help of this view, you can find out how long your expected walking distance to the next bike for a given hour at a given weekday will probably be. </p> 
		<p>To start, select the week day and hour you are interested in at the right side of the page. Afterwards klick on a spot on the map where you want to start the bike ride. After a few moments, some colored circles will appear around this spot. The colors indicate how probable it is to find at least one free bike in the colored circle area at this hour and weekday. The calculation is done by counting the weeks there was a bike in this distance and dividing it by the total number of weeks in the database.
The circle colors mean the following probabilities: </p> <p>
<span style = "font-weight: bold">Red:</span> 25% chance<br/>
<span style = "font-weight: bold">Orange:</span>  50% chance<br/>
<span style = "font-weight: bold">Yellow:</span> 75% chance<br/>
<span style = "font-weight: bold">Green:</span> 90% chance<br/>
